New work in this project is licensed under the new berkely license.  That includes
most of the executable files in the tool chain, and the run-time library.  See the
file 'berkely.lic' for details.

An exception is that the WIN32 header files were derived from GNU sources, and
are covered under the GNU lesser public license.  Since these files are header
files rather than code it is unclear whether using them causes the GNU licensing
terms to attach to derivative works.  See the file 'copying' for details.
